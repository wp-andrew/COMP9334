# COMP9334 - Capacity Planning of Computer Systems and Networks

### Course Summary
We live in a world that events do not happen instantly. It takes a certain amount of time to download a video from a server to your own mobile device. It takes a certain amount of time for a computer to finish the execution of an algorithm. The time to completion (or response time in performance analysis terminology) is a performance metric that computer scientists and computer engineers should be concerned about because no one wants to wait unnecessarily. If you can understand the factors that determine the response time, then you can influence those factors so that the response time is acceptable. This course will take a mathematical modelling and analytical approach to understand response time in computer systems and networks. The primary goal is to explore how mathematical modelling and mathematical methods can be used to model, analyse and design computer systems and networks so that they have good performance.

There are three major topics that will be covered by this course:
- Queuing analysis (Note: Queues are important because they give rise to waiting time.)
- Discrete event simulation
- Integer programming for network design
